#1) Create a program that allows a user to continue to add people to an address book 
#until the user quits. Once the user quits, break out of the loop and print out the name
#and address of everyone in the address book
#Steps
#Create a function that will ask user for name and addresses and stores them in 
#a dictionary
#Define an empty dictionary with which to work (global or local variable?)
#Begin a loop that will continue to ask a user for information until the user "quits"
#If the user does not quit, ask for a name and address and store the variables into
# variables
#Add information to the dictionary with name as the key and address as the value
#If the user does quit, end the loop
#Print out the information from the dictionary in a formatted way
#Execute/Call the function

def get_full_information(first_name, last_name, address_book):
    full_info = first_name + ' ' + last_name + ' ' + address_book
    return full_info.title()

while True:
    print("What is your name?")
    print("enter 'q' at any time to quit")
    
    f_name = input("First name: ")
    if f_name == 'q':
        break
    
    l_name = input("Last name: ")
    if l_name == "q":
        break
    
    address = input("Home addres: ")
    if address == 'q':
        break

###Exercise 2
###2) Best Time to Meet
#Billy is trying to figure out if there is a time that he and his team can meet to work 
#on the project. His three teammates each give him a list of times they are available 
#('HH:MM' 24-hour). Create a function that will take in an original list plus any number 
#of lists of teammate's available times (remember *args) and return a list of times where 
#everyone can meet.

person1= {'09:00', '10:30', '11:30', '12:00', '13:00', '14:30'}
person2= {'09:30', '10:00', '10:30', '12:00', '14:30', '16:00'}
person3= {'09:00', '09:30', '11:00', '11:30', '12:00', '13:30', '14:30', '15:00'}
person4= {'11:00', '11:30', '12:00', '14:00', '14:30', '16:30', '17:00'}


result = person1.intersection(person2, person3, person4)
        

print(result)
